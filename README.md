Carnival is a game where you play as a dog exploring a world-wide festival! Play games like Sapo from Argentina, Whack-a-Mole from Japan, penguin sliding in antarctica, and even kangaroo fighting in australia. 
This game was inspired by Google Doodle's 2024 Olympics game (https://doodles.google/doodle/doodle-champion-island-games-begin/)

This Game features
- A grid created on slick 2D, which allows users to explore the entire festival and visit statues at each country. Each country has a totally different style!
- 6 unique minigames representing the culture and biology of countries from every continent! Make sure to check out the whack-a-mole game from Japan!!
- A ticketing system: win tickets at the minigames, then cash them in for cute accessories at the central store.
